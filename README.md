## Bootcamp Project Team Ugo-Viv
# A template from Google[https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo] Microservices kubernetes project

## Expectation
Using the Template from Google, Each teams are to achieve the following: Write your deployment plan and pipeline to complete the following
- on git push/commit you project should deploy to a kubernetes cluster

- on update of something within the code, your project should update your applications to reflect the update

What we expect

On commit, your deployment should package all your services and update your artifacts repository (docker image repository, AWS Container registry, Nexus or Google, you are free to choose which service to use)

After images are dene, your infrastructure as code should deploy the image to the respective micro service

NOTE: you are free to add any design of deployment that will help you achieve this except for the one used on the Google Microservice Template
